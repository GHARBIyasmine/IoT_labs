## TP2 Edge computing and data filtering for Industrial IoT (IIoT)

The objective of this lab (or practical session) is to create a simple prototype for interpreting data filtering and fusion processes at the Edge. The prototype consists of the following components:

- **Data Generation and Publishing:** On your PC, a simulation application generates physical sensor data, which is then published to an MQTT broker located at the Edge (on a Raspberry Pi or virtual machine).

- **Data Reception, Filtering, and Fusion:** On the Edge device (Raspberry Pi or VM), another application receives the sensor data, applies filtering techniques, and performs data fusion to reduce the volume of the data. The reduced data is then sent to the cloud, which is simulated by your PC. The PC also hosts a broker to receive the processed data.

- **Traffic Analysis and Visualization:** Using Wireshark on your PC (chosen for its speed), we analyze the throughput of the traffic generated by the simulated sensor data. We also visualize the reduced traffic being sent to the cloud. This allows us to observe the bandwidth gain achieved through data reduction.

The file capteur-periodique-aleatoire contains the code for both publishing and receiving data on the host machine, while the file edge-processing-moving-averages includes the code executed on the Edge device, where data is received, processed, and sent back after applying the moving averages and reduction.

The following figure illustrates the result :
